<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Transfer Markup Language and is used to create websites. In HTML, there are tags to put certain kinds of
information on a website. For example, the "<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>" tag is used to display a block of text. There are many other tags that allow you to add
images, videos, and headers. Along with tags are attributes, which are used to alter the appearance of web content. For example, a tag to
add images to the website would have width and height attributes to change the size of images. HTML provides information but doesn't do much
styling of websites. In order to make websites look appealing by adding colors, backgrounds, fonts, etc., HTML works with Cascading Style 
Sheets (CSS), which is another language that changes how websites look rather than add information.</p>
