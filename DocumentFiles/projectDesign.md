### What is a problem statement

A problem statement is an actionable summary of your user, their goals, and steps to take to meet those goals. There is a strong emphasis on why you design a functionality not how.
The goal of your user story is to set a path to create a user's experiance.  

A problem statement doesn't include design elements or user funtionality. 

Key elements of an effective problem statement include:

- Gap: Identify the gap (pain) that exists today.
- 
Timeframe, location and trend: Describe when and where the problem was first observed and what kind of trend it is following.
- Impact: Quantify the gap (cost, time, quality, environmental, personal, etc.)
- Importance: To the organization, the individual, etc. to better understand the urgency.

### How to write a problem statement

When writing your problem statement remember all the information gathered while engaging with users. Wheile conducting interveiws, how did the users interact with other products? What caused frustiation? What was easy?

While writing the problem statement remember:

- Who: Who is impacted by this issue? Make sure to get specific by including information from what you know about users’ demographics, psychographics, personas, and other findings from user research.
- What: What is the problem? What are the obstacles users are facing? What are they trying to do? What will make the process less difficult?
- Where: Where will they be using the product? Is there a specific context in which the problem comes up? Is the issue purely digital or is there a physical component?
- Why: Why is this important? Why will users benefit from solving this problem?

> Career foundary, Cynthia Vinney

Describe who the users are, what they want, where they'll use the product, why their problem is important. 

### Examples

> Parents need a way to quickly and easily access high-quality information about teaching their kids how to avoid internet scams because currently it is hard to find resources about this topic, which leads to uncertainty.

> I am a grandparent who wants to be able to easily see and talk to my grandchildren on a weekly basis, but I can’t because they don’t live nearby, which makes me feel lonely and disconnected.

> A single young adult’s problem is that she doesn’t know anyone in the new city she just moved to. How can we help her figure out where to go to meet people and make friends so she doesn’t feel isolated?

> A parent of two needs to find high-quality resources in order to successfully teach his kids how to avoid internet scams.
