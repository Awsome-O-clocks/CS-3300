- Projects will be broken down into the following categories:

    - **To Do** - Tasks that need to be completed
    - **In Progress** - Tasks that are currently being worked on
    - **Done** - Tasks that have been completed

- Our iterations will follow the example of "Guided Exploration #", with length determined by the start and end date of our given assignments

    - To create a new iteration:
